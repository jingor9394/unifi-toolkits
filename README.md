# Unifi Toolkits
Some functionalities are not available on the web console, 
neither unifi os nor self-hosted controller.

This project provides some toolkits as follows:

## 1. Prune offline clients
Only the offline clients without a custom name will be pruned.
It is exactly the same action that you click "Remove" button on the web console.

## 2. Print mac address filter
